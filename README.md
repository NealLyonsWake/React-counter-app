# New React App

My new app, following the documentation for React Hooks, `useState` and `useEffect`.


## What Happens?

### The Counter
You can increase and decrease the counter value by clicking the plus and minus buttons.
You will notice the value will increase or decrease when a button is clicked. The page title will also update to display the counter value.

### Kanye West Quotes
You can click on the call quote API which will call a new quote from Kanye Rest.


## Overall Summary
I enjoyed learning this and React is a powerful and useful tool.


Thank you for reading.
